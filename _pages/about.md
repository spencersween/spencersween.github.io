1. [December 11, 2025] A first draft of my soon-to-be job market paper is now available. You may find it here. In this work, I study how a targeted financial access program, the Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) program, impacts local entrepreneurship activity. Using a semi-parametric difference-in-differences design and debiased machine learning, I find significant positive effects of CDFI lender entry into a local credit market on startup formation rates, while ex-ante and ex-post measures of new firm quality remain unchanged. Feedback on the draft is warmly welcomed.
1. [TBD] On my Projects page, I provide clear, reproducible tutorials for implementing cutting-edge causal machine learning strategies for applied economists. These include tutorials on Automatic DML (Chernozhukov, Newey, et al. 2021) for empirical strategies targeting complex functionals of conditional means and regression objects, as well as on Structural DML (in the spirit of Farrell, Liang, and Misra 2025) for analyzing parameters from structural models embedded with flexible, covariate-specific heterogeneity.
1. [TBD] In a new working paper, I develop debiased machine learning estimators for non-linear difference-in-differences. As an empirical application, I re-examine the effects of state-level tax credit incentives on startup formation and startup quality. On my Projects page, you may find an initial implementation of these estimators using the DoubleML and Torch packages in R. A dedicated R package and a Python translation will soon be available on my Github.
1. [TBD] AI researchers, the applied economists are coming for you! In a new project, I use structural debiased machine learning methods to estimate and conduct inference on Bradley-Terry models for pairwise comparison data on large language models. My approach allows preference parameters to vary flexibly with contextual information and input conversation embeddings, enabling rich heterogeneity and disciplined semi-parametric inference. The project overview is available here and will soon be released as a working paper. Stay tuned.
