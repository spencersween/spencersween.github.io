About Me

I do cool stuff. 

Current Work and Why You Should Hire Me!
------

I do really cool stuff that would make you a lot of money. 

Recent Highlights
------
1. **[December 11, 2025]** A first draft of my job market paper is now available! You may find it [here]("https://spencersween.github.io/Projects"). I study how the Community Development Financial Institution program affects local entrepreneurship. Using a semi-parametric difference-in-differences design with debiased machine learning, I find CDFI lender entry into a local credit market increases startup formation, while measures of new firm quality remain unchanged. Feedback is warmly welcomed.
1. **[TBD]** On my [Projects]("https://spencersween.github.io/Projects") page, I provide reproducible tutorials for applied economists on cutting-edge causal machine learning methods, including Automatic DML for complex conditional functionals and Structural DML for structural parameters with covariate-enriched heterogeneity.
1. **[TBD]** I develop new debiased machine learning estimators for non-linear difference-in-differences and apply them to study the impact of state tax credit incentives on startup activity and quality. A replication R implementation using DoubleML and Torch is available on my [Projects]("https://spencersween.github.io/Projects") page, with R and Python package releases forthcoming soon.
1. **[TBD]** AI researchers, the applied economists are coming for you! In a new project, I apply structural debiased machine learning to estimate Bradley-Terry models for pairwise LLM comparison data, allowing preference parameters to vary flexibly with contextual information and conversation embeddings. A project overview is available [here]("https://spencersween.github.io/llmevalulationproject"), with a working paper coming soon.
