excerpt: 'We develop a semiparametric difference-in-differences framework and establish identification, estimation, and asymptotic inference results under a generalization of the conditional-on-observables parallel trends assumption, which requires continuity at a zero-exposure boundary. The framework accommodates heterogeneously adopted designs and time-varying, continuous treatments. Nonparametric identification exploits the existence of quasi-stayer units at arbitrarily small treatment exposure, while parametric identification is available under additional restrictions on potential outcomes. When stayer units are available at any exposure value, the our framework yields trivial extensions to existing frameworks and estimators under a sequential version of parallel trends. For time-varying treatments, we define and study a set of summary average causal effect parameters. Our estimators are Neyman orthogonal, allowing for first-stage nuisance functions to be estimated with machine learning methods. We illustrate the framework with two applications: (i) a re-examination of employment elasticities with respect to unemployment benefit duration from Dube et al., 2018; and (ii) new evidence on the effects of the 2005 Community Reinvestment Act reform, which altered disclosure requirements for small and medium-sized banks, on entrepreneurial activity.'
