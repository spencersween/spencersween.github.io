excerpt: 'We develop a framework for analyzing complex and time-varying, continuous treatments in a difference-in-differences setting where parallel trends hold conditional on covariates. Our framework accommodates settings in which treatment doses vary across units within periods, and units may accumulate many or few doses across periods. To address these environments, we introduce a mildly strengthened sequential parallel trends assumption, requiring the presence of (quasi-)stayers in each treatment-administering period. Under this condition, we identify a full sequence of treatment effect parameters that summarize the impact of each incremental dose over time. We establish both parametric and nonparametric identification results and construct efficient estimators that combine these results with recent advances in debiased machine learning, allowing flexible first-stage estimation. The proposed framework applies even when there is no never-treated group and provides interpretable parameters for summarizing dynamic treatment responses.'
