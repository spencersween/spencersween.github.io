excerpt: 'This study explores how cryptocurrency portfolio diversification affects investment behavior during a stablecoin redemption risk crisis. Using evidence from the depegging of Terra (UST) in May 2022, I study whether Terra's price mechanism failure created risk perception spillovers within the broader stablecoin asset class. If expectations regarding non-Terra stablecoins' long-run values are affected by such a redemption risk shock, then downstream effects on trading behavior in non-stablecoin assets may occur through complementary expected income effects. I implement an event study approach to compare stablecoin-exposed investors to unexposed cryptocurrency investors before and after Terra's price crash. In doing so, I find that perception-driven, expected wealth shocks to non-Terra stablecoin holders induced excess sell-offs of up to 6.5% of outstanding holdings in cryptocurrencies. The magnitudes of these perception-driven responses are initially similar in size to the effects of a direct, realized wealth loss from holding Terra at the time of its crash. To conduct this analysis, I leverage a novel dataset from the bankruptcy filings of the trading platform Celsius Network, which provides the daily balances of over 200,000 cryptocurrency investor portfolios in cryptocurrency and stablecoin assets over the shock period.'
