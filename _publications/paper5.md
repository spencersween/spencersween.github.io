excerpt: 'This paper develops an econometric framework to isolate the incremental effects of a single treatment intervention in settings where continuously measured policies are implemented repeatedly over time. Traditional difference-in-differences methods aggregate causal responses across the entire treatment path, potentially obscuring the ability to precisely quantify and interpret policy effects arising from a marginal increase in treatment exposure. To address this, we introduce a “single-shot” treatment effect parameter, which captures the average intertemporal response to the first non-zero treatment increment. We establish semi-parametric identification results and propose new estimators that flexibly integrate machine learning techniques to control for high-dimensional covariates. Applying our methodology to the U.S. Small Business Administration’s 504 program—a policy that subsidizes financing for large capital investment projects to spur regional economic development—we find that a single guaranteed 504 project increases local employment by approximately 1.1% over five years, with no significant effect on wages. Our results reveal substantial local employment multipliers in the manufacturing sector that conventional methods understate.'
