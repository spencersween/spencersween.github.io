excerpt: 'Large language models are increasingly deployed as general-purpose inputs, making model selection and routing a central economic problem. Models differ sharply in both user-evaluated quality and inference energy costs, yet standard evaluation relies on global rankings that mask contextual heterogeneity and provide limited guidance for welfare-relevant deployment. This paper develops a semiparametric econometric framework for estimating heterogeneous human preferences over large language models and for designing cost-aware routing policies. I introduce a heterogeneity-enriched Bradley–Terry model in which latent preference parameters vary flexibly with prompt embeddings, enabling inference on smooth performance surfaces without ad hoc prompt partitioning. Estimation uses a structural deep learning approach that yields Neyman-orthogonal inference for nonlinear functionals. Applying the framework to randomly assigned pairwise preference data for 50 models from the French government’s Compar:IA platform, combined with model-specific energy cost measures, I show that context-dependent routing can substantially reduce energy use while incurring only modest reductions in predicted user-evaluated quality.'
