excerpt: 'Entrepreneurial entry is often constrained by limited credit access, especially in disadvantaged regions and among underserved groups. Because productive startups can generate substantial local gains in employment and income, there is strong policy interest in alleviating credit market frictions. The U.S. Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFI) program supports mission-driven lenders that expand credit access for targeted populations and areas. This paper examines how local CDFI access influences productive startup formation and labor market outcomes. Using a semiparametric difference-in-differences design that exploits staggered CDFI entry across regional credit markets, I find that CDFI presence significantly increases startup formation without lowering the average firm quality. The effects are strongest in areas with higher minority shares. These results suggest that CDFIs mitigate long-standing credit constraints, fostering productive entrepreneurship.'
