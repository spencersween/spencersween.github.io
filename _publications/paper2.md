excerpt: 'I develop difference-in-differences methods for discrete and weakly positive outcomes under non-linear, conditional parallel trend assumptions. The methods are tailored to entrepreneurship applications, where outcomes are discrete or weakly positive and treatment exposure may be non-binary. The framework estimates effects on outcome-consistent link scales, admits multi-valued and repeated treatments, and accommodates flexible, high-dimensional covariate adjustment via modern machine learning. I also introduce a Heckman-style, sample-selection correction model within a semiparametric, DiD approach, estimated with a structural neural network architecture. Using data from the Startup Cartography Project and replicating Guzman et al.\ (2020), I re-analyze the effects of state R\&D tax credits on entrepreneurial activity at the extensive (entry) and intensive (quality) margins. I estimate impacts on startup entry counts and growth-event probabilities, recover the exposure–response to tax-credit generosity, and assess startup quality with the proposed selection-correction model. The estimates indicate no detectable effects on formation rates or quality, whereas the original study reports a 7\% formation effect using log-plus-one transformations. A companion \texttt{R} package is provided.'
